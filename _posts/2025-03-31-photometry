I have finished my pipeline to reduce and stack images. Now I have to do photometry calculations on my stacked image. Unfortunately, I'm having trouble with photutils. I have installed it on my python environment, but I can't import it in VS Code. Without it, I can't even begin to do photometry calculations, so I need to get that sorted as fast as possible.
