Last week was Spring Break, so I didn't get a lot done. I skimmed a few papers and chose one to present on in class. I'm having trouble figuring out which papers will be relevant to my project, as TIC 101 is in a few catalogs and papers, but not mentioned explicitly. Also, since my project is primarily on models, I don't know what the ratio of papers on TESS stars in general to papers that use these models should be.
I downloaded <i>starry</i> and <i>PHOEBE</i>. I've attempted to install both, and play with them, but have run into errors in installing "wheels". I'm not sure what those are or why there are issues. My pipeline is almost done. It calibrates the images well, but doesn't align them. I have also only tested it on the data we acquired at Perkins. I need to download the TESS data and determine what needs to be done to reduce it. I also need to fix my aligning portion of my pipeline and make preliminary light curve plots.
