My project is on comparing binary star system models. I will be looking at the system TIC 101220458 (TIC 101), with both TESS data and data my group and I collected at Perkins. I will be modeling the system with three models, STARRY, PHOEBE, and the WD method. I will then compare the resulting parameters. Part of my analysis will involve testing how robust the models are; I will input different amounts of data and see how similar the results are. At the end, I will discuss the three models: their inputs, outputs, and various use cases. I will make plots showing the parameters I have obtained for TIC 101 and for the comparison of the models' inputs. 

This week, I plan to finish my pipeline code for the Perkins data and start working on code to analyze the TESS data. 

Papers on these three models: [Luger (2019)](starry.pdf), [Prsa (2005)](prsa.pdf), and [Wilson & Devinney (1971)](wd%20algorithm.pdf).
