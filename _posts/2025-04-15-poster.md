1. What was the main goal of your work this semester? Or, alternatively, what were you trying to test? (these don’t have to be exactly what you planned in your proposal)
   I wanted to compare different eclipsing binary models.
3. What data did you use, and what did you do to the data to clean it or take measurements?
   I used data from Perkins this year and last year and I plan to use TESS data as well. I made a pipeline to sort, calibrate, and register the images. I also used the DiffPhot.py module from class to get my differential photometry.
5. What will you conclude (most likely) from your work? This should directly address the goals or experiments you defined in #1 above.
   I'm not sure yet. I still haven't put my data through any models, as I'm still exploring them.
7. What are two important plots, diagrams, or visualizations you’ll want to show? You don’t need to make final versions of these yet, but you should write down in words (or literally sketch) what they’ll look like.
   Light curves for both models, compare and contrast models' inputs and outputs
